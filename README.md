# Bash Scripts

Bash scripts that I think are useful in day-to-day terminal use.

- Set the individual script or the folder containing them to your `PATH`

With the youtube script, you can open up youtube with a search query already included using the terminal:
```
youtube how to reverse a linked list
```

The google script works similarly:
```
google how to balance a binary search tree
```
